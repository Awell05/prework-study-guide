       <h2>HTML</h2>
       <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) gives the content structure. It builds the frame of a website.</li>
          <li>HTML elements are the building blocks of a website</li>
          <li>   Elements: are case-sensitive and usually composed of an opening tag <> and a closing tag </> represented with angle brackets</li>
          <li>   Elements in the "BODY" are visible to users. 
                  All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>   Elements in the "HEAD" ARE NOT visible to users.
                  It provides important information about an HTML document and website that is used by the browser so the page renders correctly.</li>
          <li>HTML "HEAD" elements include the following:

            DOCTYPE html: This declaration tells the browser what document type it should expect when it is opened. not case-sensitive
      
            html:  opening tag, represents the root, or start, of our HTML document.
      
              head:  element contains the metadata for our web application to render the page correctly.not visible to the user
      
                meta:  element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
      
                title: element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required & extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
                     Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines such as Google or Bing.
      </li>
      <li>You can include different types of META aka metadata.</li>
        <li>What is METADATA?</li>
          <li>METADATA is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. It contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.
          title: element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
          style: element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.
          base: element defines the base URL for a webpage.
          link: element connects an external resource to the HTML document.
          meta: element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.
          script: element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
      <li>"BODY" elements </li>
      <li>AKA "Parent Element"</li>
      <li>Semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage
              Important role in making sure your webpage is accessible to the widest variety of users</li>
      <li>Non-semantic elements such as < div> to create a division in the page, or < span> to create an inline division. 
              Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve.</li>
      <li>Child elements: Elements that are nested inside other elements </li>
      <li>ELEMENT refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag,
        TAG refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
      <li> < h1>, < h2>, < h3>, < h4>, < h5>, and < h6> elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents
         The biggest heading < h1 >, should only appear once on each page.</li>
      <li>Child Elements</li>
      <li>< p> elements represents a paragraph or block of text.
        use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages</li>
      <li>< ul> bullet point</li>
      <li>< ol> order list</li>
      <li>< li> unordered lists</li>
      <li>    Example: 
                < ul>
                < li> information < /li>
                < li> information < /li>
                < /ul></li>
      <li>< img> IMAGE element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage
        can contain various attributes 
        `src` attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image
        `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.
            alt text is important for screen readers and other assistive technologies. 
            It can also improve search engine rankings for your website.
          EXAMPLE: 
          < img
          src="https://static.fullstack-bootcamp.com/prework/module-03/lesson-01/cute-pandas-02.jpg"
          alt="Cute Pandas"
          width="520"
          height="346"
        /></li>
      <li>< a> element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.
              `href` attribute points to the URL for the link, as shown in the following code
              < a href="https://nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/giant-panda">More About Giant Pandas < /a>
      </li>
      <li>< br> element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
      <li>< footer> appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
      <li>< section> elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
      <li>HTML uses the `id` attribute as a way to identify elements and select them</li>
       </ul>
      </section> 
     
      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.
            define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage
            inline CSS style sheet 
            internal CSS style sheet 
            external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>INLINE 
            -styles an element directly in the HTML file. Apply it to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. 
            -useful for quick and permanent changes
            -less flexible than external and internal style sheets 
            -each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change
          
            < h1 style="color:red;">Prework Study Guide< /h1>
          </li>
          <li>INTERNAL 
            style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.
            rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. 
            Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>EXTERNAL style sheets  most common way to style a webpage. It allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.
              When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a < link> element placed in the HTML's < head>, as shown in the following code:</li>
          <li>CSS elements: selector {property: value; property: value} -declaration block </li>
          <li>Selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.
            class attribute as the selector. Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. 
            Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property. example on 3.2.3
            For example, the declaration color: blue; includes the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
          <li> * selector  declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the style properties margin and padding set as 0:</li>
          <li>combining two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors
            two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together. This helps us write Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code.
            </li>
          <li> <img > selector assigns property values to any image element in the markup. The display property is assigned with the block value, which assigns each image to start on a new line.
            positioning property, text-align</li>
          <li> margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document. 
            indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; </li>
          <li> padding property adds space around the content inside an element. 
            When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger!</li>
          <li> rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li> href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li> The margin property assigns 40px to the top and bottom, and the auto value to the left and right.
               The border property assigns a border with a width of 5px that is solid and gray.
            </li>
          <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. 
            You can set multiple effects separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color. 
            In our example, the X offset is 5px and defines the width or extent of the shadow on the X axis (or to the right of the box); 
            the Y offset is 10px and defines the extent on the Y axis (or just below the box). We haven’t defined the blur or spread radius here 
            An HTML hexadecimal code defines the color.</li>
